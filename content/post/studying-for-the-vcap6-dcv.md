Here are SOME of the resources that I worked through as study material for the VCAP6-Design exam. A lot of these links and the discovery of these links can be attributed to a lot of others, and I'll try to credit them where I can.

* [vBrownBag EMEA - VCAP6-DCV Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bh1035s4V7s&list=PLYt3WRI29sdYQD2DMhBNTgQrjNtA3XqTg) - vBrownBag YouTube channel
  * Some great presenters here that highlight some of the key concepts and follow up with discussions
* [vThing - VCAP Study Resources](https://vthing.wordpress.com/2016/03/21/vcap6-dcv-design-study-resources/) - Andres Herceg's blog https://vthing.wordpress.com
  * Andres has done a great job collecting VCAP links. I strongly suggest you check it out.
* [ElasticSky - Preparing for the VCDX](http://www.elasticsky.co.uk/vcdx_defense_design_scenario/) - Paul McSharry's blog
  * Paul McSharry does a great job breaking down VCDX process and gives you an insight into how the VCDX panel, and by extension VMware, think about design.

More will be added as I dig them up.
