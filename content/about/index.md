Hello, I'm Stellios. This is my personal tech related blog for anything private and public cloud related. I love (almost) anything virtual and cloud.

Almost every blog post and tutorial I seem to find online is written around a green field deployment where somehow issues or bugs are not found and you're unlikely to find the really juicy problems. My initial goal was to to keep this blog limited to fixes and how-to's that I couldn't find anywhere else, but I've noticed that since starting the blog I'm slowly creeping into the 'opinion' side of blogging. I'll try to keep that to a minimum or at least coherent!

I love designing and building out private cloud infrastructure and I'm having an absolute ball working with public cloud offerings and finding new ways of doing things.

Any fixes or workarounds that I've detailed on this site are provided as is. Your environment will probably differ to the one I work in so please don't hunt me down if it doesn't work...

If you're wondering why there are Ads being served on this blog, any money from them goes to supporting my homelab to help bring you even more content.

My postings are my own and don’t necessarily represent VMware’s positions, strategies or opinions.
