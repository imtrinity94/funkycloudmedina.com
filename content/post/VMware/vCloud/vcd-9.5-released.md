VMware has released vCloud Director 9.5!

If you go to the My VMware downloads section you won't find it. You need to change the URL so it has "9_5" on the end:

[vCloud Director 9.5 Download](https://my.vmware.com/group/vmware/info/slug/datacenter_cloud_infrastructure/vmware_vcloud_director/9_5)

Assuming you have the right entitlements, you'll be able to start downloading the upgrade bin's and the OVA.

To find out what's new, VMware have released a PDF highlighting all the new features: [What's new with vCloud Director 9.5](https://cloudsolutions.vmware.com/assets/blt4e4a9fe9b7954100/What's%20New%20with%20vCloud%20Director%209.5.pdf)

Some of the stand out features for me are:

- Fully functional HTML5 client for tenants.
  - With support for independent disks!
- vCloud Director appliance on Photon OS 2
- IPv6 support for guest machines
- API enhancements
  - Swagger UI
