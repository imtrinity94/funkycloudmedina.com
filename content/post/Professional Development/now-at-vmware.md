After many years of working with VMware products and having been on the receiving side of VMware's support and business development team, I can now hop the fence and make a difference directly with VMware!

I was given the amazing opportunity to join the Brisbane office in Queensland, Australia as a Technical Account Manager and today was my first day! Without a doubt, there is plenty to learn and do over the next few weeks (maybe even months) and I expect this blog will take a temporary back seat until I've taken the reigns and settled into my new life. I have a few draft posts that I can keep working on but they won't be a priority.

To any VMware employees reading, it's great to join the team and I look forward to meeting/working with you.
