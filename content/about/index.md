# About Me

Hello, I'm Stellios. This is my blog/dumping ground for anything private and public cloud related.

I'm VCIX6 and MCSE certified with AWS certifications coming soon. I love private cloud architecture and public cloud flexibility.

I got sick of encountering problems in my current workplace that were so unique you couldn't find the fixes online. Anything I manage to fix or fix with a vendors assistance will be put here for everyone to enjoy.
