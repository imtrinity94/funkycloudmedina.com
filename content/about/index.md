# About Me

Hello, I'm Stellios. This is my blog/dumping ground for anything private and public cloud related. Almost every blog post and tutorial online is written from a green field deployment or homelab where you're unlikely to find the really juicy problems. I try to keep it limited to fixes and how-to's that I couldn't find anywhere else, but sometimes the fixes that are out there are too good not to share.

I'm VCIX6 and MCSE:Cloud Infrastructure certified with AWS certifications on the way. I love designing and building out private cloud infrastructure and I'm having an absolute ball working with public cloud offerings and finding new ways of doing things.
