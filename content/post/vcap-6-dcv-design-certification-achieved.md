After months of studying and a Design and Deploy course for good measure, I passed the incredible VCAP6-DCV Design exam!

This certification in combination with my VCAP5-DCA from 18 months ago has awarded me the VCIX6 title which I'm incredibly proud of. Here's the official link from VMware about the certification:Â https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrReg/plan.cfm?plan=89125&ui=www_cert

To give you an idea of what the Design exam is about, take a look at [www.virtualtiers.net](www.virtualtiers.net). That exam simulator is a great representation of how the exam is formatted and how you're tested. The content isn't the same as the exam for obvious reasons, but it helps.

I'll be doing a quick post sometime soon on all the resources I've collected during my preparation.
