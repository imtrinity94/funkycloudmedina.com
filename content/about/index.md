# About Me

Hello, I'm Stellios. This is my blog/dumping ground for anything private and public cloud related. I try to keep it limited to fixes and how-to's that I couldn't find anywhere else, but sometimes the fixes that are out there are too good not to share.

I'm VCIX6 and MCSE certified with AWS certifications coming soon. I love private cloud architecture and public cloud flexibility.

I got sick of encountering problems in my current workplace that were so unique you couldn't find the fixes online. Anything I manage to fix or fix with a vendors assistance will be put here for everyone to enjoy.
