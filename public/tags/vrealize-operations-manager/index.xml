      <description>A quick post today! I was trying to configure the vRealize Operations Manager Outbound REST notification plugin recently and I was having a few issues doing a POST or PUT operation against the specified endpoint. Specifically, I was getting the following message:
 Test was not successful: Failed to post or put to the server.
 I tried looking around the vROPs Logs section under Administration &amp;gt; Support &amp;gt; Logs but couldn&amp;rsquo;t find anything specific for Outbound Notification plugins.</description>
